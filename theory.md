### Theory

Though the forging process generally gives superior quality products compared to other
manufacturing processes, certain defects are likely to occur if proper care is not taken
during forging process design and operation.

Forging defects can be broadly classified into two categories:
- Geometrical Defects
- Non-Geometrical Defects

### Geometrical Defects

Geometrical defects arise due to improper die design, poor process parameters, or incorrect
material flow during forging.

### Main Types of Geometrical Defects

1. Laps and folds  
2. Underfills  
3. Overfills  

Other geometrical defects include:
- Piping
- Forging shape not matching the design
- Die deflection, yielding, or wear
- Eccentricity or buckling

### A) Unfilled Section

In this defect, some sections of the die cavity are not completely filled by the flowing
metal. The main causes of unfilled sections are improper forging die design and incorrect
selection of forging techniques.

### B) Cold Shut

Cold shut appears as small cracks at the corners of the forging. This defect is mainly caused
by improper die design, where corner radii or fillet radii are too small. As a result, the
metal does not flow properly into the corners and forms a cold shut.

### C) Laps and Folds

Laps and folds are caused by improper die design and incorrect material flow. These defects
appear as overlapping metal layers on the forged surface. Laps distort the surface finish
and weaken the product due to the presence of internal or external cracks.

Less-than-optimum process and preform design is the principal cause of most geometrical
defects. When press or hammer dies close, the workpiece moves along the path of least
resistance. If the die or preform design creates an undesirable flow path, defects are
formed.

By understanding these process issues, the die designer can modify the die and preform
design to ensure proper metal flow and produce a sound, defect-free forging.

### Non-Geometrical Defects

Non-geometrical defects mainly affect the internal structure or surface quality of the
forged component.

---

### A) Flakes

Flakes are internal ruptures caused by improper cooling of large forgings. Rapid cooling
causes the exterior to cool and contract quickly while the interior remains hot, leading
to internal stresses and fractures. This defect can be avoided by following proper cooling
and heat treatment practices.

### B) Scale Pits

Scale pits appear as irregular depressions on the surface of the forging. They are caused
by improper cleaning of the stock material before forging. Oxide and scale present on the
surface get embedded into the forging during deformation. After pickling or cleaning, these
defects become visible as pits on the surface.
