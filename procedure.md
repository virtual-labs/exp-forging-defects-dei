### Procedure


1. Start the forging defects experiment or simulation and review the basic forging process used for component manufacturing.

2. Select the forged component or sample to be analyzed for possible defects.

3. Examine the forging visually to identify surface defects such as laps, folds, cold shuts, and scale pits.

4. Compare the observed geometry of the forged part with the intended design to check for underfills, overfills, or shape mismatches.

5. Inspect critical sections of the forging for signs of eccentricity, buckling, or improper metal flow.

6. Study the forging die and preform design to identify possible causes of geometrical defects.

7. Analyze the cooling and heat treatment history of the forging to detect non-geometrical defects such as flakes.

8. Identify the root causes of each observed defect based on design, process, operation, or maintenance factors.

9. Record observations and classify each defect as geometrical or non-geometrical.

10. Suggest corrective measures to eliminate or minimize the identified forging defects in future production.
